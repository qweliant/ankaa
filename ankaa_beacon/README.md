## Todo

- [x] make this a monrepo
- [x] push incoming IoT data to timescale or influxDB
- [ ] build out notification service
- [x] triggering alerts
- [ ] adding people to care network
- [ ] viewing care network realtime hemodialyis and bp. probably doesnt require a dashboard. letting users know the patient is online and providing notifications if something is wrong could be the only view
